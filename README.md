================

Project moved to https://github.com/gini/puppet-git-hooks


githooks(5) scripts to work with repositories of Puppet code.


Installation
------------

Just copy the scripts to your repository into the ``.git/hooks/`` directory.
Make sure that the filename conforms to one of the hooks listed in
[githooks(5)](http://git-scm.com/docs/githooks) and that the executable bit
has been set.


Hooks
-----
**pre-commit:**

This pre-commit hook verifies that Puppet can parse \*.pp files (using ``puppet parser validate``),
that the manifests conform to the [Puppet Labs style guide](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/style_guide.html),
and that templates (\*.erb) have valid syntax.
